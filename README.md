# mushroom-neural-network
A Neural Network trained to recognize 10 species of mushrooms

## The dataset
The images were collected using Bing API and python. They can be found in the folder **data** which contains a folder for each species.
We choose to identify the 10 following species : 
 - Amanite tue-mouches
 - Cèpe
 - Bolet de Satan
 - Truffe
 - Champignon de Paris
 - Girolle
 - Morille
 - Entolome livide
 - Vesse-de-loup
 - Coulemelle

*Bolet de Satan* and *Cèpe* are very similar and *Morille* is easily recognizable, so we find it interesting to see the results we will achieve on those.
